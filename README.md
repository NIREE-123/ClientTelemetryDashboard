Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage - February 2026 Completed a Deloitte job simulation involving data analysis and forensic technology. Created a data dashboard using Tableau. Used Excel to classify data and draw business conclusions.

Created dashboard based on the factory with the most downtime machine. Aanalysed the telemetry data collected by Daikibo in a software called Tableau. Here are the steps that i used:

Created a calculated measure field called "Unhealthy" with a value of 10 for every unhealthy status (representing 10 mins of potential down time since the previous message). Created a bar chart called “Down Time per Factory”. Created a new sheet with a new bar chart called “Down Time per Device Type”. Create a Dashboard with the 2 previous sheets and set the first chart to be used as a filter (selecting a factory in the first chart shows only the down time of the machines in this factory in the second chart). Selected the factory with the most down time (click on its bar).

Used Excel to classify data and draw business conclusions.Here i found equality class based on equality score. when equality score is less than or equal to 10 then its fair, less than or equal to 20 then its unfair orelse highly discruminative.
